<h1>DWR Project - BLACK FRIDAY </h1>

Overview: This competition on Analytics Vidhya focuses on predicting customer purchase amounts during Black Friday sales. Participants analyze demographic and product data to uncover purchase patterns, aiming to help retailers better understand consumer behavior and optimize sales strategies.

Problem Statement: The objective is to predict purchase amounts for different customer-product combinations using historical data. This task involves analyzing attributes like user demographics and product categories to derive a model that can make accurate predictions for each pairing.

Dataset Information: The dataset includes variables like customer age, gender, occupation, city, product categories, and purchase amounts. Challenges include missing values and diverse customer segments, which require careful handling and feature engineering for effective predictions.

Solution Approach: Data preprocessing includes handling missing values and exploring feature correlations. Feature engineering often involves creating interactions between demographic and product-related variables. Participants apply various machine learning models, such as regression and ensemble methods, fine-tuning to improve accuracy.

Results: The final model aims to accurately predict purchase amounts, offering insights into factors influencing customer spending. Results are assessed using RMSE, with top models revealing patterns in consumer behavior and segment-specific purchasing trends.
